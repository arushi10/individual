## Week 0

### 5.1 
Notes
* Technological innovations have both positive and negative impacts
* UAVs/Drones are used in search & rescue, aerial photography, and for hobbies; also have unintended uses
* Automated telephone trees: purpose - save employers money + reduce hold time for customers


Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing 
* Three beneficial effects of computing are it makes information more accessible, minimizes paper usage and is thus, more eco-friendly, and allows work to be distributed quicker and to a wider audience. Three harmful effects of computing are degradations in physical and mental health, increase in socio-economic divisions, and elimination of paper-based industries. 


Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
* The dopamine rush that comes with certain digital applications can cause potential problems, especially if it makes the application addictive. Many students at Del Norte are addicted to gaming or social media because of this dopamine issue. Three computing innovations that cater to the dopamine are social media, TV, messaging, and gaming.

### 5.2
Notes
* Poorer or rural areas in America and other countries may have less or little access to technology
* Some countries may have different or restricted access, for instance China and USA may have divide in service allowed in their countries
* Contributing factors to digital divide: socioeconomic (money), geographic (location), demographic (education, nationality, religion, and ethnicity)
* Individual may have less access to latest updates, thus may be working on older generations of computers
* Religious groups like the Amish choose not to use technology
* San Diego county has regional distinction in many categories between Northern and Southern population, usually indicated by Interstate 8.
* Sunnyvale CA has been know as technology hub of influence for the entirety of the United States


How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
* To empower themselves, someone can use digital platforms to share their thoughts and ideas. Additionally, they can digitally collaborate with a diverse range of people, which helps them become a global citizen.


How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
* Someone that is empowered can teach people who are not empowered how to use certain technologies, so they too can take advantage of them. Something I can do to digitally empower students at Del Norte is to organize workshops about CS topics.


Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
* Financial barriers sometimes prevent certain groups of people from accessing technology. One way we are overcoming these divides at Del Norte is by providing free Chromebooks to people who request them.

ADDED QUESTION: How can computer science and a knowledge of technology empower you?
* The top four companies in the stock market are Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), and Apple. It is important to note that all of these companies are tech companies. This goes to show that studying technology, particularly computer science, is very valuable in today's day and age. 

### 5.3
Notes
* computers have intentional and unintentional bias
* HP face tracking feature: most likely unintentional
* developers may not have had diverse skin colors, flawed testing


Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
* no


If yes or no, justify you conclusion.
* No because the developers did not test accurately.


How do you think this happened?
* Testing was flawed.


Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
* Yes, it is harmful because if the facial recognition feature malfunctions in a critical process, it could be disastrous. It was not intended to exclude.


Should it be corrected?
* Yes, it should be corrected to make the feature more accurate.


What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
* Test the facial recognition feature on people with different skin colors.


### 5.4 
Notes
* more crowdsourcing = less computing bias
* crowdsourcing allows us to obtain shared information, share information, and participate in distributed computing
* ex: Wikipedia - has inaccuracies corrected through self-policing community; crypto currency and associated block chain - transactions are verified at least 3 times; COVID-19 data
* RapidAPI, Github


CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
* One crowdsource idea is to calculate the carbon footprint of San Diego. This can be done by asking all Del Norte students to calculate their individual carbon footprint using a carbon calculator and compiling the data.


What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
* Del Norte has a diverse array of students that can be very effective for crowdsourcing. For our project detailing emergency procedures, we can talk to teachers and students about the digital features that would help them in an emergency situation.
