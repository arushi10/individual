### What can I do with Tech to improve mine or others' education?

Technology can increase connectivity between people, so it helps students learn from each other and optimizes the teaching process. I can use technology to study with my classmates, for example, or email my teachers if I have questions. Additionally, technology allows 24/7 access to information that helps make education more convenient. I can use technology virtually anytime to answer my academic inquiries. Being exposed to a wide range of information through technology drives me and my peers to be more curious and interested in learning. Furthermore, technology helps incorporate different learning styles. For instance, I prefer to take notes online rather than on paper because I can make changes easily. Technology is more accommodating of this preference; therefore, I can use technology to understand the material taught better. Since technology has numerous benefits when used for education, I am motivated to develop online educational resources using the skills Iâ€™ve learned so far in AP CSP.


### Scrum Team Project Description

Our goal this trimester with our website is to make a helpful and viable alternative to phyiscal manuals during an evacuation. We hope to convert all paper necessities into an online format as well as add other pages that would make evacuating on short notice easier. Overall, we hope to make the hassle of evacuation as simple and least stressful as possible.
